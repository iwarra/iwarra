### Hi there, I'm Ivona 👋

I'm a frontend web developer with a background in communications and management. Playing with my blog was the initial spark that ignited my interest in programming. I enjoy building things and love to combine functionality with design. In my free time, I love learning new things, reading books, and petting dogs. 

I am a volunteer for [Pink Programming](https://www.pinkprogramming.se/), a non-profit organization that encourages women to learn programming.
